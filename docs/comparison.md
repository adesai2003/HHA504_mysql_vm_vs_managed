For a small student application, the clear choice is the VM. This workload is highly sensitive to cost and has very simple administrative needs. A minimal Compute Engine instance, like an e2-micro, is significantly cheaper than the entry-level pricing for Cloud SQL. While the initial setup effort is higher—requiring manual installation, firewall configuration, and user creation—the ongoing maintenance for a simple hobby app doesnt matter. The  monthly cost savings for the student budget easily outweighs the  administrative costs since concerns like multi-zone high availability or automated storage scaling are unnecessary.

For a departmental analytics database that supports multiple teams and is critical for business insights, Cloud SQL is the better option. The managed service automatically provides essential features like automated daily backups and automatic storage scaling. This prevents system downtime when storage capacity is unexpectedly exhausted. The  staff's focus should be on deriving value from the data, not on the complex, repetitive task of patching the operating system or database software. The increased cost of Cloud SQL is justified by the higher uptime, reduced security risk, and the significant administrative time savings.

Finally, for a highly regulated and sensitive HIPAA-aligned workload, the best choice is a Cloud SQL instance, especifically one configured with High Availability (HA) and Private IP networking. Compliance with HIPAA’s technical safeguards requires robust audit trails, strict data security (encryption in transit and at rest), and near-zero downtime. Achieving these standards manually on a VM is not only complex and time-consuming but also introduces high potential for human error and compliance failure. Cloud SQL is built to better handle these concerns, offering automated multi-zone failover, built-in encryption, and simplified network controls that keep Protected Health Information (PHI) off the public internet.
